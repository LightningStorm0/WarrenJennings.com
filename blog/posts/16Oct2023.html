<text class="card-title">Welcome to my website!</text>
<p>
    Recently, I realized that I need a place to show off some of my work.
    My old website was getting a bit stale, and wasn't as flexible as I hoped, so I started on this one!
</p>
<p>
    <b>I wanted this website to be a few things:</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean</li>
        <li>Hosted on <b>GitHub pages</b></li>
        <li>Easily understood through the version control history</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Here's how I achieved those things...</i>
</p>
<text class="card-subtitle">1. Clean</text>
<p>
    I wanted a simple visual style that I had a complete understanding of, so I decided to develop the <b>css</b> myself.
    I used <b>CSS</b> variables to make sure that my color scheme is consistant and can easily be updated.
    Also, I made sure to match the <mark>marking color</mark> to the theme, as I feel it ties the website together.
</p>
<text class="card-subtitle">2. Hosted on GitHub Pages</text>
<p>
    Hosting this site on <b>GitHub Pages</b> makes my life easier and cheaper.
    I focused on designing my website so it can be run on a rudamentary <b>HTTP</b> server.
    This means that unless I want all my separate pages to be static <b>HTML</b>, I had to implement some <b>JavaScript</b> on the client-side.
</p>
<p>
    The website loads each of the blog posts <i>(stored as HTML files)</i> from a separate folder where they are stored, and places them on the page as they load.
    This helps the website load quickly and dynamically.
    In the future, I plan on adding a loading system that only loads enough posts to fill the page, and continues to load as the page scrolls.
    I would also like to add some sorting and filtering on which posts are loaded/displayed, so I can have lots of different topics on this site!
</p>
<text class="card-subtitle">3. Understandable Version Control</text>
<p>
    Keeping each post into it's own file makes each commit easy to understand.
    And adding a file every time a post is made just makes sense to me.
    There is a <b>JSON</b> file that needs to be updated as each post it added.
</p>
<text class="card-subtitle">The Future</text>
<p>
    I plan on updating this website with my projects, and possibly doing some writing about programming?
    Honestly, I'm not to sure where this is going to go.
